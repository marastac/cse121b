        <h2>Care and Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>During the rental period, it's crucial to provide proper care and attention to the rented pet. As a responsible temporary pet owner, you must ensure the pet's well-being and safety.</p>
        <p>Our guidelines include providing a safe environment, feeding the pet according to our instructions, and giving them plenty of love and affection. We also recommend introducing the pet to their temporary home gradually to make them feel comfortable.</p>
        <p>Please treat the pet with care and respect, just like you would with your own pet.</p>
